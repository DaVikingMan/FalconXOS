# This article is about Operating Shells

Well lets extend the 'why build a Operating Shell?' question

Well the short answer is 'For making a better terminal without compromising anything'.

So you can also say that Operating Shells are a superset of Terminals

This app uses default terminals because I have noticed that this makes it more ram-efficient and cpu-efficient and reduces error rates for the app.

The Operating Shell's UI will be amazing and the Operating shell itself will be ram-efficient

The Operating Shell will also have a built-in package manager which will be like the 'homebrew of windows' because I think that windows really needs a package manager.

The Operating Shell will also have built-In WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) and SSH support(the SSh support will take some time).

# Some more FAQS
{
    The Operating Shell will have a standalone app.
    Only the commands will be executed in the Operating System's terminal
    So you will write the command in the Operating Shell but the execution process will be in the terminal(such as CMD)
    
    
    Note : All the command outputs will be shown in the Operating Shell so you can say that the execution process will be a kind of background process
}

Also Note : The Operating Shell is not the app itself but it will open when you will execute the 'terminal' commmand in the app's menu.

Operating Shell is a new term and technology made by me.

Note : All these features which are noted above will be added at a later update
