### This file explains the different branches of FalconXOS

This branch is the Falcon branch where the most updated features are added
Due to this, the features may not be stable and have some errors
<br>
When the Falcon branch gets stable, the features are released to the Eagle-Eye branch where the features are complete and more stable
<br>
Also even though the versions are the same in both branches, it doesn't mean that the features are the same.
<br>
If the version codename is the same then the features are the same,so check the codename in the 'VersionOverview.md' to check if there any feature differences between the two versions.
