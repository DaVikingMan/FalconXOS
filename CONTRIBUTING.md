## If you are contributing documentation

The same contributing guidelines should be followed for fixing and adding documentation
Try to make the contribution which you are making as clear as possible by pointing them in the pull request.
You can write something like:

Although this is optional and you can make the changes visible by following any format of your choice

### If you are testing developement builds

Note : The developement builds refer to the Falcon versions(master-Alpha and Linux-Alpha)
<br>
The same contributing guidelines will have to be followed
Also make sure on which operating system you are testing the dev build
For example :
<br>
OS : <insert os name here>
OS version : <insert version here>

And if you encountered an issue describe how you ran into the issue:
For example:
Issue caused when I was <insert reason here>
If you were using some kind of software which FalconXOS doesn't natively support
<Write the name of the app which you used to run FalconXOS> : <What did you do to run it>
Although the second format after ':' is optional
