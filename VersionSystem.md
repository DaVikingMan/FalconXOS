# This file gives an overview of the VersionSystem that the 'Falcon' branch of FalconXOS follows

The 'Falcon' versions of FalconXOS will mostly follow the 'every commit:push'
This means that every four to ten local commits I do I will push those changes at that time

This means that updates will be regular and may not be stable and have some bugs
