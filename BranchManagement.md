# About the branches in this repository

Before, the master branch was the default branch but now the Alpha branch is the default branch

Now , the master branch has been deleted as it was quite difficult to maintain different versions of FalconXOS

The Alpha branch is now classified as the 'main branch'
When this app will have support for Linux and macOs, I will create a 'Linux-Build' and 'MacOs-Build' branch.



Any other updates on the branch system will be added here.
