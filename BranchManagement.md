# About the branches in this repository

Before, the master branch was the default branch but now the Alpha branch is the default branch

Now, the master branch is classified as a 'developement build',
Which means that the master branch will not get any updates

Now only the alpha branch will get updates and will be the main app

When this app will have support for Linux and macOs, I will create a 'Linux-Build' and 'MacOs-Build' branch.

Any other updates on the branch system will be added here.
