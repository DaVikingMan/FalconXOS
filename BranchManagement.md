# About the branches in this repository

Before, the master branch was the default branch but now the Alpha branch is the default branch

Now , the master branch has been deleted as it was quite difficult to maintain different versions of FalconXOS

The Alpha branch is now classified as the 'main branch'

All versions prior to v.30 will have the 'Alpha' name in the branch
The 'Alpha' branch is for Windows while 'Linux-Alpha' is the Linux version

Any other updates on the branch system will be added here.
