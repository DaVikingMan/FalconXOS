# System Requirements for Windows 10

For Windows 10, you need .NET 5.0(this might work in earlier versions of .NET but this app was only tested using .NET 5)

For running changelog.js and debug.js, you need nodejs installed
You also need CMD installed(all windows 10 installation have command prompt pre-installed)
