# System Requirements for FalconXOS-GNU/Linux

The system requirements are as follows : 

-Node.js(latest version recommended)
<br>
-A compatible linux kernel(if you are on a linux distro)
<br>
-A compatible version of MacOS(if you are on a mac)
<br>
-Dotnet(v5.0+, preview versions should also work)
<br>
-Java(latest version recommended)
<br>
-Bash/Zsh/Ksh/anything that is a shell
<br>

Note : FalconXOS will now be tested on EndevourOs(which is based on Arch Linux)
This should work on other distros also
<br>
FalconXOS is not tested in macos but it should work on macosX+(any mac version which supports dotnet 5 can run this version).
<br>
By theory, FalconXOS-GNU/Linux should work on all unix-like operating systems(including minix(if you managed to install dotnet and java on your system then yeah, but packages for these are not available), BSD and macos)
