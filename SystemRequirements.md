# System Requirements for Windows 10

For Windows 10, you need .NET 5.0(this might work in earlier versions of .NET but this app was only tested using .NET 5)

You also need CMD installed(all windows 10 installation have command prompt pre-installed)

Note : For now, TerminalXOS has only support for Windows 10.
Support for Linux and macOs will be added at a later version.
