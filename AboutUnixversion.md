# About the unix version of FalconXOS

The unix version is the version which is tested on selected unix-like operating systems and is calculated accordingly for if it will work on other unix-like systems.
<br>
This branch follows Linux-Alpha as currently there is no difference between unix and Linux-Alpha branch
<br>
Eventually, when more updates are released some features which are required to run FalconXOS will differ.
<br>
For example, for the macos-build on later updates FalconXOS might use Xcode features and may use swift-ui.
<br>
So for macos, a new branch will be created from this branch.
<br>
For other operating systems like BSD-inherited operating systems and Redox-os(and Oracle Solaris), the unix branch should work
<br>
Currently, all unix-like operating systems will work with the unix-version of FalconXOS
