# This documentation is about UFT(User-Friendly Terminal)

'Not to be confused with Operating Shell'

UFT is the part which runs when you launch FalconXOS.

(Note : UFT is not Operating Shell.They are both different parts of FalconXOS.)

The UFT includes everything that has been implemented in the src folder.

UFT uses text-commands(for example: 'Shortcuts') which makes it more easier to write than normal terminal commands.

But UFT isn't used to write terminal commands.
It is used to do stuff that normal terminals can't do.

For example : You can create Shortcuts in UFT.
You can manage Projects,
You can debug your application,
and more.

So UFT is not a terminal.

Note : Operating Shell will still be a different part of FalconXOS and shouldn't be confused with UFT.
