'Not to be confused with normal terminals'

<br>
UFT is the part which runs when you launch FalconXOS
<br>
<br>
<b>Note : UFT is not Operating Shell.They are both different parts of FalconXOS.</b>
<br>
<br>
The UFT includes everything that has been implemented in the src folder.
<br>
UFT uses text-commands(for example: 'Shortcuts') which makes it more easier to write than normal terminal commands.
<br>
<br>
But UFT isn't used to write terminal commands.
It is used to do stuff that normal terminals can't do.
<br>
For example : You can create Shortcuts in UFT.
You can manage Projects,
You can debug your application,
and more.

So UFT is not a terminal.
<br>
<br>
Note : Operating Shell will still be a different part of FalconXOS and shouldn't be confused with UFT.
