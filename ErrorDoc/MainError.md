# This file lists the main errors and their fixes

### Error 0102

This usually means that the command which you have typed as an input doesn't match the input which FalconXOS had expected.
For example, if you have typed '/Exit' instead of '/command Exit'
This error only occurs in else-if or if-else statements

### Error 0323-e

This error occurs outside of else-if or if statements.
This means that the input which you have given does not match a command name

### Error 0102-internal(Info-Error)

This is an extremely rare error and usually occurs when there is an error in the code typed or the feature is incomplete(and I have added the error to inform that this part is not completed)

### Error 02302internal

This is the same as Error 3 but occurs when the correct path is not assigned

### Error internal102

This is a FalconXOS error and should be reported to the issues tab if found

Note : For now, the ErrorList is implemented manually and occurs when you have typed something wrong.
From version .20, the error system will be automatic.
