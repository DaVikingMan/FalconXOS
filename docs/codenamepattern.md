# About the codenames of versions

Each codename is either based on an anime referrence or a dystopian one.
<br>
For example, Black Sun is a dystopian referrence and the codename 'serious-series' is a anime referrence.
<br>
<br>
Version numbers are decided by the number of features it add and not the number of releases.
<br>
For example the next release will .24.90 and the release after that will be .29.99 instead of .25.xx.
