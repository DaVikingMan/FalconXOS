# How to setup developement environment for editing FalconXOS's source code

To setup FalconXOS for adding and removing code:
You must have:
-All the dev tools required to run FalconXOS
-A text editor or IDE.
-And you should be an intermediate at the programming language which the part which you will be testing is written in.

<br>
<b>
First, run the install.bat script(if you don't have any of the packages required for running FalconXOS).This will install all the dev packages
<br>
<br>
Second, install a text editor.If opened in vscode, FalconXOS doesn't need any tweaking or removal of code but if opened in a IDE like visual studio you might have to remove the .vscode.
If you open it in a text editor like vim(which I recommend), no removal of code is necessary.
<br>
<br>
Third, start coding and tweaking FalconXOS to your style.
