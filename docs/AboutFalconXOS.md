# About FalconXOS and the project

I just wanted to tell everyone that FalconXOS isn't a terminal.
<br>
Its completely different from a terminal.
<br>
FalconXOS is a set of cl tools for executing, building, increasing workflow and being able to customize.
<br>
FalconXOS as a group contains many things, in that one of them is the User-Friendly Terminal the current component which starts.
<br>
<br>
The second one is the Operating Shell, which is a type of shell(like zsh and bash)but contains many exclusive tools.
<br>
For example, a build tool, a cmake alternative, a advanced project generator and tools which are developed towards developers like me those love the command line and do everything from it.
<br>
Although, you can call FalconXOS an operating shell as it is one.
<br>
You can say that User-Friendly Terminal is a part of Operating Shell.
