# This documentation is about some of the special commands

Special commands are those commands which start with '/command'.

For example, you may have noticed that sometimes in order to exit a command you need to type '/command Exit'.

By running '/command Exit', you are forcing the system to exit the page.

This can be useful when you had accidentally typed the command but you want to execute another command
<br>
Normally, you can only exit after a command has been completed

There are other /command's such as
:
- When you are at the starting screen, you can type '/skip -debug' for skipping to the DebugManager class.

Note : Commands which don't start with '/command' but instead start with '/skip' are known as 'command enhancers',
these are used to enhance the '/command'

/command executes with FalconXOS related commands such as force exiting,
<br>
/skip executes command to skip to another class.
<br>
There is also '/state' which is also a 'command enhancer'
Command enhancers are those commands which enhance '/command'.
Therefore, the base of /command will be followed in command enhancers
There are many command enhancers, but they will be added at a later version.
