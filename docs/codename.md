## This file lists all the codenames of FalconXOS's parts

Note : This is only for referrence as I sometimes write the codename of the component instead of it's name.
Codenames are the names which I use to note them as it is much easier.
The actual names are the codenames but since they are somewhat long, you can refer to them as their component name.
For example, instead of referring to FalconXOS as 'Gray Falcon', you can call it just FalconXOS
