# FalconXOS : a Operating Shell
<b>Welcome to the FalconXOS repository.FalconXOS is still in alpha stages and is on version .19.
  <br>
For seeing when version 1(The first complete version of FalconXOS) will be released, you can check the README.md.
<br>
I will add version 1 when it will be released when it is complete.
<br>
  <br>
                                      FalconXOS is a terminal which redefines the meaning of terminal.It will have almost every tool you can imagine.
<br>
From compiling tools, to package manager and also user-extensions.
<br>
The best thing is that it's open source so if you think that 'meh, this feature doesn't show its true potential', you can always add code.
<br>
And if you want to bring the changes which you made to FalconXOS, you can do so.

# Note

This part lists some of the future updates this project will have
All features are subject to change


FalconXOS is a terminal for the future

It brings the 'live in the terminal' quote to reality
This means that you will be able to do everything from the terminal

# About the future of this app

I want to make FalconXOS the best terminal possible

These are some of the things which I will add in the upcoming updates


-A built-In terminal(Operating Shell, this is a new tech and the docs about this will be added when FalconXOS will be completely released) because as of now the app launches powershell by default
<br>
-A package manager for the terminal
<br>
-Some utilities for enhancing the terminal. For example we will be adding a build tool called tr which will help you run your projects in a more enhanced way.
<br>
-Full support for macOs(as for now FalconXOS only supports windows and Linux)
<br>
Note : Operating Shell doesn't refer to FalconXOS but refers to a standalone terminal which will come up when executing the terminal command in the app's menu(Subject to change.The Operating Shell might have an independent menu for it).


# Some FAQS

You may have noticed that at the top of the README that it says FalconXOS : a Operating Shell

Well I wanted to modify some principles used to make a terminal

Operating Shell is the same as a terminal in many ways but is also different in several ways.

Both of them are used to execute commands, but Operating Shell uses a different execution environment.
It uses a  hybrid execution system(more on that afterwards).

Also Operating Shell will be more customizable and will also have support for user-extensions.
# Now you may ask that why build a Operating Shell?

Because what I want to build is a ram-efficient and cpu-efficient terminal without sacrificing stability, performance and features.

And this can only be done when we use the principles of Operating shell.


If you notice the terminals which come with your Operating System(such as CMD for windows 10 or konsole for kde), they are actually the most ram-efficient but they compromise good UI and features.


For example Command Prompt only uses 7mb of Ram and 0.1% cpu.
