### This is the Falcon branch

# <b>@Recent change- Renamed TerminalXOS to FalconXOS</b>

Note : The Linux-Alpha build is still in alpha stage and has some bugs

# FalconXOS : a Operating Shell
<b>FalconX Operating Shell(full form)</b>

# Welcome to FalconXOS

Welcome to a more modern and better terminal

# Note

This part lists some of the future updates this project will have


FalconXOS is a terminal for the future

It brings the 'live in the terminal' quote to reality
This means that you will be able to do everything from the terminal

Managing shortcuts
Running apps
And much more,


# About the future of this app

We want to make this app the best terminal possible

This are some of the things which we will add in the upcoming updates

-A built-In terminal(Operating Shell, this is a new tech and the docs about this will be added when FalconXOS will be completely released) because as of now the app launches powershell by default
<br>
-A package manager for the terminal
<br>
-Some utilities for enhancing the terminal. For example we will be adding a build tool called tr which will help you run your projects in a more enhanced way.
<br>
-Full support for Linux and macOs(as for now this has only support for windows as this uses windows tools for execution)
<br>
Note : Terminal doesnt refer to the app but refers to a standalone terminal which will come up when executing the terminal command in the app's menu.


# Some FAQS

You may have noticed that at the top of the README that it says FalconXOS : a Operating Shell

Well we wanted to make modify some principles used to make a terminal

First, 

Defination of Operating Shell-
This part has been removed and will be added when FalconXOS will be completely released.


This is different from a terminal as a terminal is a shell which directly gives command to the Operating System.

# Now you may ask that why build a Operating Shell?

Because what I want to build is a ram-efficient and cpu-efficient terminal without sacrificing stability, performance and features.

And this can only be done when we use the principles of Operating shell.


If you notice the terminals which come with your Operating System(such as CMD for windows 10 or konsole for kde), they are actually the most ram-efficient but they compromise good UI and features.


For example Command Prompt only uses 7mb of Ram and 0.1% cpu.

Sorry for the inconvience
The next 2 updates will mostly fix bugs and make the existing features more better
