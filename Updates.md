-This is a bug fix which addresses the issue with changelog.js.
Although changelog.js still doesn't work in FalconXOS, you can run the RunChangelog.sh script to run it

The shell script 'start' has also been added to run FalconXOS instead of running of 'dotnet run'
If the shell script doesn't run and gives an error, you need to:

Give permission by running:
chmod +x name-of-script
And in order to run it:
./name-of-script

Note : Changelog of bug fix versions will not be written in changelog.js and only complete versions such as 'v.16' will be written.
